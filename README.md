# Climate-Crop-Yield-Prediction
This project predicts crop yield using a stacked ensemble model combining XGBoost and CatBoost with a Ridge meta-model. After encoding, scaling, and removing correlated features from an agricultural dataset, the model was trained and evaluated. It achieved an excellent RÂ² score of 0.94, and the final model was saved for future deployment.
